<p>Two decades ago when Java was born, it brought a concept of Inheritance. What is inheritance and what are the rules of inheritance?</p>

<p>Inheritance allows a class to be a subclass of a superclass and thereby inherit public and protected variables and methods of the superclass. Inheritance is a key concept that underlies IS-A, polymorphism, overriding, overloading, and casting. All classes (except class Object) are subclasses of type Object, and therefore 
they inherit Object's methods.
</p>
          <p><strong>Rules</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Subclasses know their parent (super classes) that they inherit from but super classes doesn't know anything about the sub classes.</li>
             <li>An Interface can <strong>extend</strong> "n" number of interfaces / abstract classes</li>
            <li>An Abstract class can <strong>implement</strong> "n" number of interfaces but can only <strong>extend</strong> one Abstract class, in fact an Abstract class can as well extend a concerete class.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Now you might question how on the earth would that work (Abstract class implementing "n" number of interfaces?). Well that's a very smart question. As a JAVA developer you must know this <strong>feed in your brains</strong> when JVM looks at an Interface it sees an abstract behavior in it. 
          Wow! Now that's a lot to process right?. Let's have a look at a picture below:</p>
          
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjshaikh/jj/gh-pages/images/CompilerAtInterface.JPG"/>
          
          <p>Now we know for sure right?. So, it's safe to say now that there is no problem for an abstract class to implement intefaces and extend classes (abstract/concerete).
          As soon as a concerete class extends that abstract class, it has to implement all of the (abstract) methods that it's bringing with itself.</p>
