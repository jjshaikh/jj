<p>Two decades ago when Java was born, it brought a concept of Inheritance. What is inheritance and what are the rules of inheritance?</p>

<p>Inheritance allows a class to be a subclass of a superclass and thereby inherit public and protected variables and methods of the superclass. Inheritance is a key concept that underlies IS-A, polymorphism, overriding, overloading, and casting. All classes (except class Object) are subclasses of type Object, and therefore 
they inherit Object's methods.
</p>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Subclasses know their parent (super classes) that they inherit from but super classes doesn't know anything about the sub classes.</p>

          <p><strong>Practical joke</strong>: 
Two dacades ago Java was born and brought the cocept of Inheritance with it. which states childs can know about their parents but parents doesn't know a thing about 
their childs. Wonder it's 20th century and seriously parents doesn't know who their childs are :D.
